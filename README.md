### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer that loves working/learning about topics all across the stack, from the physics behind a single transistor to running a massive Kubernetes cluster over many billions. The brain has always been an area of deep interest to me and when I was younger I even dreamt of working in medicine to gain a better understanding. Soon I realized though that I'm more of a builder, and that the best way to truly understand how cognition works is by taking a stab at reverse engineering it. Right now I'm very interested in the rapidly developing field of Machine Learning and how we can already leverage it (and technology more broadly) to help people make better decisions in their daily lives that they previously would not have had the CPU cycles or massive scale of data to make without a computer.

Right now, I'm wrapping up my Master's degree at Georgia Tech ðŸŒ± 

Some books that have inspired me deeply:
